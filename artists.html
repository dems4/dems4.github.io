				<h2>Charlie Parker</h2>
				<p>Considered the joint founder of bebop, along with Dizzy Gillespie, alto saxophonist Charlie Parker brought a new level of harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic sophistication to jazz. His music was controversial at first, as it drew away from the popular sensibilities of swing. Parker’s bebop is regarded as one of the most important steps in jazz history, just as important today as it was decades ago.</p>

					<h2>Dizzy Gillespie</h2>
					<p>Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie was Charlie Parker’s friend and collaborator, and after playing together in the swing jazz ensembles led by Earl Hines and Billy Eckstine. Gillespie pushed the limits of the jazz trumpet, demonstrating prolific technique that often screamed into the instrument’s highest registers. After the early days of bebop, he went on to become a living jazz icon, helping to introduce Latin music to the jazz repertoire, and also leading a big band on diplomatic tours around the world.</p>

					<h2>Sonny Stitt</h2>
					<p>Largely influenced by Charlie Parker, alto and tenor saxophonist Sonny Stitt built his style on the language of bebop. He was especially adept at alternating between lyricism and fast, accented bebop lines on blues song-forms and ballads. His virtuosic and spirited playing represents the technical and energetic heights of bebop.</p>

					<h2>J.J. Johnson</h2>
					<p>Trombonist J.J. Johnson was one of the leading trombonists in jazz. He began his career in Count Basie’s big band, playing in the swing style that was beginning to fall out of popularity in the mid-1940s. He left the band to play in small bebop ensembles with Max Roach, Sonny Stitt, Bud Powell, and Charlie Parker. The advent of bebop marked a decrease in the use of the trombone because it is not as capable of playing fast and complex lines. However, Johnson overcame the instrument’s obstacles and paved the way for modern jazz trombonists.</p>

					<h2>Thelonious Monk</h2>
					<p>As a pianist, he had a unique improvisational style and made numerous contributions to the standard jazz repertoire. His compositions and improvisations feature dissonances and angular melodic twists and are consistent with his unorthodox approach to the piano, which combined a highly percussive attack with abrupt, dramatic use of switched key releases, silences, and hesitations.</p>

					<h2>Bud Powell</h2>
					<p>As a young man, pianist Bud Powell fell under the tutelage of Thelonious Monk, and the two helped define the role of piano in bebop at Minton’s Playhouse jam sessions. Powell became renowned for his accuracy at fast tempos, and for his intricate melodic lines that rivaled those of Charlie Parker. A member of the famous quintet that recorded Jazz at Massey Hall, a 1953 live album that featured Parker, Max Roach, Dizzy Gillespie, and Charles Mingus, Bud Powell was plagued by mental illness, exacerbated by a 1945 beating by police officers. Despite his illness and early death, he contributed tremendously to bebop, considered one of the most significant jazz pianists.</p>

					<h2>Ray Brown</h2>
					<p>Known for his hard-driving swing and rich tone, bassist Ray Brown began playing with Dizzy Gillespie when he was 20 years old. During his five years with the great trumpeter, Brown became one of the founding members of what would become known as the Modern Jazz Quartet. However, he left to play bass in Oscar Peterson’s piano trio for over 15 years. He went on to lead his own trios​ and became known as one of the masters of the bass, setting the standard for time-feel and sound.</p>

					<h2>Oscar Pettiford</h2>
					<p>He was one of the earliest musicians to work in the bebop idiom, after he moved to New York, he was one of the musicians (together with Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Kenny Clarke) who in the early 1940s jammed at Minton's Playhouse, where the music style developed. He and Dizzy Gillespie led a group in 1943. Worked with Duke Ellington from 1945 to 1948 and for Woody Herman in 1949 before working mainly as a leader in the 1950s.</p>

					<h2>Kenny Clarke</h2>
					<p>Drummer Kenny Clarke played a pivotal role in the transition from swing to bebop. Early in his career, he played with swing bands, including one led by trumpeter Roy Eldridge. However, as the house drummer at the famous Minton’s Playhouse in Harlem, he began to shift the means of keeping time from the snare drum and hi-hat to the ride cymbal. This allowed independence of each of the parts of the drum set, adding to the explosive sounds of bebop.</p>

					<h2>Max Roach</h2>
					<p>Drummer Max Roach played with some of the greatest musicians of his time, including Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, and Miles Davis. He is credited, along with Kenny Clarke, for having developed the bebop style of drumming. By keeping time on the cymbals, he reserved the other parts of the drum set for accents and colors. This innovation gave the drummer more flexibility and independence, allowing him to become more of a presence in the collaborative bebop ensemble. It also made the lightning-fast bebop tempos possible.</p>

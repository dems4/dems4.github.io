			<p>Bebop is a style of jazz that occurred in between the mid-1940’s till the early 1950’s and was developed by a younger generation of jazz musicians that expanded the creative possibilities of jazz beyond the popular swing music, which intended to be popular dance music, palatable to a mainstream audience, bebop while still rooted in the same traditions that swing grew from, would ultimately be very different.</p>
			<p>While main ensembles of the swing era were the big bands of up to fourteen pieces playing arranged composed tunes with more simple harmonies and some space for improvisation, bebop was based in small ensembles like trio’s, quartet’s and quintet’s focused on improvisation rather than on complex arrangements.</p>
		    <p>In this period, soloist were virtuosos who imparted much harmonic information in their improvisation and exhibited a new of rhythmic articulation. These components – virtuosity, heightened emphasis on soloing, a fuller use of harmony, and a new rhythmic sense – established bebop as a new type of jazz and was a turning point in jazz history.</p>
		    <p>The music was characterized for being very dynamic, played usually at very fast tempos, a different way of grouping notes in relationship to the song form and a longer, irregular phrasing. The compositions had complex, angular melodies usually played in unison, and a more increased harmonic complexy than before, like alterations and substitutions of standard chord progressions, although the use of contrafacts (original melody lines written over standard chord progressions) was very common. The music was emphasised on virtuosity and instrumental technique.</p>
		    <p>In the ensemble there was much more interaction, the drummer had a less explicit timekeeping role and is now more interactive with the soloist, the comping instrument, like piano or guitar, moves away from rhythmic density towards accents and fills, and the horns move away from the arranged sections trending towards riffs and more support for the underlying rhythm while there’s more emphasis and freedom for the soloist. </p>

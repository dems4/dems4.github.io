				<p>Bebop is a style of jazz that occurred in between the mid-1940’s till the early 1950’s and was developed by a younger generation of jazz musicians that expanded the creative possibilities of jazz beyond swing music, which intended to be popular dance music, palatable to a mainstream audience, bebop while still rooted in the same traditions that swing grew from, would ultimately be very different.</p>
				<p>In the early 1940's, after classical jazz had made it's conquests, a small group used to get together every night in a Harlem nightclub called Minton's Playhouse and some other places like Monroe's. Several young musicians, that unlike their fellow musicians, did't felt at home in the atmosphere of 'swing music', It was becoming urgent to get a little air from it. That was the aim of trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, pianist Thelonious Monk, guitarist Charlie Christian (who died before the group's efforts bore fruit), drummer Kenny Clarke and saxophonist Charlie Parker.</p>
				<p>In Minton's musicians would fall by whenever the got the chance, after their last showor even in between shows. About four years when by before any of the music that grew up in Minton's (and Monroe's) was heard by a great many people, because of the recording ban in effect at the time. In 1994, when Gillespie and Parker started recording and working in some of the 52nd Street clubs, the whole jazz world got turned around, and the non-jazz world as well</p>
				<p>While main ensembles of the swing era were the big bands of up to fourteen pieces playing arranged composed tunes with more simple harmonies and some space for improvisation, bebop was based in small ensembles like trio’s, quartet’s and quintet’s focused on improvisation rather than on complex arrangements.</p>
				<p>In this period, soloist were virtuosos who imparted much harmonic information in their improvisation and exhibited a new of rhythmic articulation. These components – virtuosity, heightened emphasis on soloing, a fuller use of harmony, and a new rhythmic sense – established bebop as a new type of jazz and was a turning point in jazz history.</p>
				<p>The music was characterized for being very dynamic, played usually at very fast tempos, a different way of grouping notes in relationship to the song form and a longer, irregular phrasing. The compositions had complex, angular melodies usually played in unison, and a more increased harmonic complexy than before, like alterations and substitutions of standard chord progressions, although the use of contrafacts (original melody lines written over standard chord progressions) was very common. The music was emphasised on virtuosity and instrumental technique.</p>
				<p>In the ensemble there was much more interaction, the drummer had a less explicit timekeeping role and is now more interactive with the soloist, the comping instrument, like piano or guitar, moves away from rhythmic density towards accents and fills, and the horns move away from the arranged sections trending towards riffs and more support for the underlying rhythm while there’s more emphasis and freedom for the soloist. </p>

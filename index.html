						<p>Jazz is one of the broadest styles, always evolving, yet retaining its traditions. It is a music that grew from the combining of many elements, and from the beginning it has been relentlessly modernistic. And bebop was one of those periods that marked a turning point in the way jazz developed.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="message-content">
						<p>Bebop came from the feeling of freedom and the excitment that came from individual expression, because all of this stared in the midst of the Swing Era, when the arrenger, not the soloist was the important man in jazz. All that freedom and experimentation led to innovation.</p>
						<p>Bop also carried a distinct element of social protest, not only in the sence that it was music that seemed antagonistically nonconformist, but also that the musicians that played it were loudly outspoken about who they thought they were.</p>
